# Charts-JS 

A sample  MEAN (MongoDB + ExrpessJS + AngularJS + NodeJS) application thats uses HighchartsJS

### Instructions
* First, you'll need to download all dependecies for both the client and the server:
```bash
$ cd charts-js
$ npm install
$ cd client
$ npm install
```
* After that, you'll have to configure your MongoDB URL in the next file:
```bash
charts-js/config/configDB.js
```
* Finally, run your server executing the command below:
```bash
npm start
```
* The magic happens at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
